                My name is Jason Bartling, and I live in San Marcos, TX.  I'm a GIS major at Texas State University.
                It's great to finally be graduating this December!  Some things I enjoy are movies, music, and books.
                In my spare time I've been trying to polish up on my Python programming skills and my drone piloting ability.

              I am a graduating senior GIS major. This is my first time coding but I enjoyed the difficult lessons and look forward to the final capstone project. I enjoy hiking and camping having recently visited Zion NP in Utah and look forward to an upcoming trip to Big Bend. The drone pictured was used in a UAS mapping project with Dr. Jensen.

              Currently I am a Graduate Student working toward my Masters of Geography at Texas State University. I graduated from Texas State with a bachelors in GIS and a minor in Computer Science in 2017. My areas of interest are Remote Sensing/GIS, Geovisualisation, and Physical Geography. Like my team members I also operate sUASâ€™s for both mapping and as a hobby.
